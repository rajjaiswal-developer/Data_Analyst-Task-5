# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights related to passenger survival during the disaster. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and identification of patterns that influenced survival rates.

## Key Findings
- Overall survival rate was about 38%.
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, 3rd class the lowest.
- Younger passengers, especially children, were more likely to survive.
- Higher fare-paying passengers had better survival chances.
- Correlation and visualizations (heatmaps, violin plots, box plots) revealed useful patterns and outliers.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Studio Code

## Objective
To understand the key features affecting survival, which can be used for building predictive models in future.

## Deliverables:
- ✔️ Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and observations. (Titanic_Analysis_Task5.ipynb)
- ✔️ PDF report export (TITANIC DATASET REPORT.pdf).
- ✔️ Titanic Dataset csv file (train.csv).
